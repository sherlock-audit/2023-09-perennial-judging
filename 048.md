# The market collateral could include "trapped" collateral that can't actually be withdrawn.
## Summary
The _collateral function that sums the collateral from each market does not check for "trapped" collateral that can't be withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail
This is because the _collateral function calculates the total collateral by summing the collateral balances across all registered markets. However, some of this collateral may be "trapped" and unavailable to withdraw in practice.
Specifically, the _collateral function doesn't account for unrealized losses on open positions. For example:
• The vault has 1 ETH collateral in Market A
• It uses this 1 ETH as margin to open a 5 ETH short position in Market A
• If the price drops, the short position will have an unrealized loss
• Even if the unrealized loss exceeds the 1 ETH collateral, _collateral will still return 1 ETH
• So the reported collateral is "trapped" behind the underwater position

## Impact
• Over-rebalancing positions based on inflated collateral estimates
• Allowing large redemptions that exceed real available collateral
• Social losses if collateral estimates are too high

## Recommendation
Have _collateral incorporate unrealized PnL into its estimates
