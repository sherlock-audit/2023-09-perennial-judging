# Collateral values from different markets are denominated in the same units, which can lead to issues summing them.
## Summary
The assumption of common collateral units is dangerous and could be manipulated. Collateral should be normalized before summing across markets
## Vulnerability Detail
The key code sections are:
1.	_collateral function: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L569-L573). This sums the collateral from the asset balance and each market into a single value.  
2. _collateralAtId function: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L581-L589) . Similar logic alos, summing the collateral from each market's position into a single value.

## Impact
If markets track collateral in different units (e.g. one in ETH, another in DAI), summing them doesn't make sense and could lead to incorrect totals.
For example:
• Market 1 collateral: 10 ETH
• Market 2 collateral: 1000 DAI
• Summed collateral would be 1010, which is incorrect.
This could allow attackers to deposit "fake" collateral that looks larger when summed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Markets should standardize collateral units, or collateral should be converted to common units before summing
