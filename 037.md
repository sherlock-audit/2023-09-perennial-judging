# The current liquidation logic in _liquidate subtracts the full closable amount uniformly from each position side (long, short, maker). This means it could liquidate more from one side than necessary if only one side is insolvent.
## Summary
It subtracts the full closable amount from each position side uniformly. However, longs and shorts may not be liquidated evenly. Can liquidate more from one side if that's the insolvent part. 
## Vulnerability Detail
1. It calculates the full closable amount based on the account's latest position: [Link 1 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L341)
2. Then it subtracts this uniform closable amount from each position side:
This subtracts the full closable amount from the maker, long, and short positions: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L231-L235)

This means if an account was long 10 and short 5, with a closable amount of 7 due to insolvency, it would liquidate 3 from the long side and 4 from the short side. But the account is solvent on the short side. 

In Essence

It's possible that only the long or only the short position is actually insolvent. In that case, it would be better to only liquidate the insolvent side rather than evenly across both.

For example, say an account has:

Long: 100 DSU
Short: 50 DSU
Closable: 60 DSU
And the short position is insolvent. Currently, it would liquidate:

Long: 100 - 60 = 40 DSU
Short: 50 - 60 = 0 DSU
When actually only the short should be liquidated:

Long: 100 DSU
Short: 50 - 60 = 0 DSU
This could lead to over-liquidation.
## Impact
This can  lead to over-liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_liquidate should calculate the insolvent amounts separately for longs and shorts based on the current price, and close each side proportional to its insolvency amount
