# The _closablePosition calculation is vulnerable to manipulation of pending positions by an attacker.
## Summary
The _closablePosition calculation depends on mutable pending position data. An attacker could manipulate positions before this calculation to incorrectly increase closable amount. 
## Vulnerability Detail
_closablePosition iterates through pending positions to calculate the closable amount: [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L539-L546)
An attacker could exploit this by:
1. Calling update() to create a pending position with a high maker amount.
2. Then calling _closablePosition() before that pending position is settled.
3. This will make the closable amount higher than it should be, allowing them to redeem more assets than they should be able to.
## Impact
The attackers is able to  redeem more assets than they should be able to.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 _closablePosition calculation should only consider settled/finalized positions, not pending ones.
