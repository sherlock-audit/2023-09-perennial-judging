# Assets that are locked in the vault are still included in the totalAssets calculation, which can make the conversions between assets and shares inaccurate
## Summary
Assets that can't be transferred out of the vault are still included in total assets. This could make the conversion inaccurate if some assets are locked. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The totalAssets() function calculates the total assets by taking the assets from the latest checkpoint and adding any new deposits and subtracting any redemptions: [Link1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L116) and [Link2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L139-L143)
This does not account for any assets that are locked in the vault and unable to be transferred out. For example, if some assets are locked as collateral in a lending protocol. Those locked assets would still be included in the total assets, even though they cannot be redeemed.

## Impact
Share to asset conversion can be inaccurate:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have  a separate variable to track the locked assets, and subtracting those from the total assets when doing conversions
