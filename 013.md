# The code utilizes low-level calls in the `_commitPrice` function, In the context of this function, the contract's behavior depends on the success of this low-level call, which introduces potential risks.
## Summary
The code utilizes low-level calls in the `_commitPrice` function, which can be risky and may lead to vulnerabilities if not used with caution.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the usage of low-level calls, specifically in the `_commitPrice` function. Low-level calls like `call` or `delegatecall` can be challenging to use correctly and securely. In the context of this function, the contract's behavior depends on the success of this low-level call, which introduces potential risks.


## Impact
The usage of low-level calls without proper handling may result in unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities. If the low-level call fails or behaves unexpectedly, it can leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L312

```solidity
function _commitPrice(
    address oracleProvider,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 index,
    uint256 version,
    bytes memory data,
    bool revertOnFailure
) internal {
    UFixed18 balanceBefore = DSU.balanceOf();

    if (revertOnFailure) {
        IPythOracle(oracleProvider).commit{value: value}(index, version, data);
    } else {
        try IPythOracle(oracleProvider).commit{value: value}(index, version, data) { }
        catch { }
    }

    // Return through keeper reward if any
    DSU.push(msg.sender, DSU.balanceOf().sub(balanceBefore));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risks associated with low-level calls, it is recommended to consider using higher-level functions or libraries that provide more safety when interacting with external contracts. A potential improvement can be achieved by using the OpenZeppelin library's `Address` utility, which includes functions for interacting with external contracts safely.

Here's an example of how to use the `Address` utility:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

function _commitPrice(
    address oracleProvider,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 index,
    uint256 version,
    bytes memory data,
    bool revertOnFailure
) internal {
    UFixed18 balanceBefore = DSU.balanceOf();

    // Use Address function to perform a call and handle exceptions gracefully
    bool success = Address.call{value: value}(oracleProvider, abi.encodeWithSelector(IPythOracle.commit.selector, index, version, data));

    // Check for success or revert based on the revertOnFailure flag
    if (revertOnFailure && !success) {
        revert("Commit failed");
    }

    // Return through keeper reward if any
    DSU.push(msg.sender, DSU.balanceOf().sub(balanceBefore));
}
```

By using the `Address` utility, you can perform calls in a safer manner, handle exceptions gracefully, and have better control over the contract's behavior in case of failures.
