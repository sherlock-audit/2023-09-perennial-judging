# Using Vault#claimReward() might accidentally transfer all of vault's current asset to vault factory's owner.
## Summary
Using Vault#claimReward() might accidentally transfer all of vault's current asset to vault owner.
## Vulnerability Detail
When claimReward() is called, it will go through each market, claim reward token and send it all to vault factory's owner. 
The problem arises when market reward token is same as vault's asset token. In this case, _registrations[marketId].read().market.reward().push(factory().owner()); will be equivalent to asset.push(factory().owner)), which will transfer all of the vault's current asset to the vault factory's owner.
## Impact
Loss of funds and disrupting vault's accounting.
