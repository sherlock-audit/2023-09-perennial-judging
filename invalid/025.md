# Contract does not implement proper access control mechanisms for the validateAndStore function, there are no checks to restrict access to authorized users.
## Summary
The code does not implement proper access control mechanisms for the `validateAndStore` function. As a result, there are no checks to restrict access to authorized users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code does not implement proper access control mechanisms for the `validateAndStore` function. As a result, there are no checks to restrict access to authorized users,

## Impact
The absence of access control mechanisms can have significant security implications:
- Malicious actors can exploit this vulnerability to make unauthorized changes that benefit them at the expense of other users and the protocol.

## Code Snippet
`validateAndStore` function is defined in the code without access control mechanisms:

```solidity
function validateAndStore(
    RiskParameterStorage storage self,
    RiskParameter memory newValue,
    ProtocolParameter memory protocolParameter
) external {
    // Validation logic
    validate(newValue, protocolParameter);

    // Store new values in storage
    // ...
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/RiskParameter.sol#L173

there are no access control checks to restrict who can call the `validateAndStore` function.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
mitigate the risk of unauthorized modifications to the risk parameters, it is recommended to implement proper access control mechanisms. One common approach is to use the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract. Here's an example of how this can be done:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract YourContract is Ownable {
    // ... (other contract code)

    // Only the owner (contract deployer) can call this function
    function validateAndStore(
        RiskParameterStorage storage self,
        RiskParameter memory newValue,
        ProtocolParameter memory protocolParameter
    ) external onlyOwner {
        // Validation logic
        validate(newValue, protocolParameter);

        // Store new values in storage
        // ...
    }

    // ... (other contract functions)
}
```

By this recommended mitigation step, the `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin is imported, and the `onlyOwner` modifier is applied to the `validateAndStore` function. This ensures that only the contract owner (the deployer) can call the function, adding access control to prevent unauthorized modifications. Adjust the access control mechanism as needed to match your specific requirements.
