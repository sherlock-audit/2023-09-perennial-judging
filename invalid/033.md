# Invalid assumption that the amount of assets claimed from the vault will equal the change in the msg.sender's DSU balance. This can lead to issues
## Summary
There is an assumption that the amount of assets claimed from the vault will equal the change in the msg.sender's DSU balance. However, this may not always be true due to things like settlement fees charged by the vault. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that claimAmount is calculated based on the balance change rather than the actual claimAssets amount.
This can be an issue because:
• The vault may charge fees like settlement fees on withdrawal
• Other operations in vault.update() like depositing could impact the balance
• External transfers could impact the balance between the two readings
So claimAmount may not equal the assets the user intended to claim.

A proof of concept exploit:
1. User claims 10 assets from the vault
2. Vault charges a 1 asset settlement fee, so only 9 assets are transferred back
3. Due to the balance change, claimAmount is calculated as 10 assets
4. The extra 1 asset is incorrectly withdrawn and stolen


## Impact
The user may end up with less assets transferred back than they expected. This could lead to unintended losses for the user if they assumed all their assets were returned.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The _vaultUpdate function should rely solely on the claimAssets amount returned by the vault itself rather than trying to infer it from the DSU balance change. The DSU balance should only be used as a sanity check rather than the source of truth.
