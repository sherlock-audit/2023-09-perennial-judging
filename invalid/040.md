# Doesn't validate account is actually undercollateralized before liquidating. Price could fluctuate between checks.
## Summary
Doesn't validate account is actually undercollateralized before liquidating. Price could fluctuate between checks. Should verify current collateralization. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The key lines are in the _liquidate function. It computes the liquidation fee and closable amount based on the latest price via _liquidationFee, but does not re-check the collateralization at the time of liquidation.
This is problematic because:
• The price could move between _liquidationFee and market.update
• An account's collateralization ratio could go from under to overcollateralized
• But its position would still get closed and charged a fee incorrectly

## Impact
 Improper liquidations if the price changes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
_liquidate should re-check collateralization at the time of liquidation. This verifies the account is still undercollateralized at the time of liquidation, preventing improper liquidations if the price changes.
