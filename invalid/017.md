# From the arithmetic operations in the _recordPrice function, specifically the variable expo6Decimal. If the value of expo6Decimal becomes extremely large or small, it could result in an integer overflow or underflow when performing operations on it.
## Summary
The "Potential Integer Overflow in _recordPrice Function" is a vulnerability in the contract's `_recordPrice` function, which performs arithmetic operations on the `expo6Decimal` variable. If not handled properly, these operations could lead to integer overflow or underflow issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the arithmetic operations in the `_recordPrice` function, specifically the variable `expo6Decimal`. If the value of `expo6Decimal` becomes extremely large or small, it could result in an integer overflow or underflow when performing operations on it.

## Impact
Integer overflow or underflow can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior in smart contracts, including incorrect calculations, unexpected state changes, and even contract halting. In the context of this contract, it could affect the recorded price data, potentially leading to incorrect oracle information.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/pyth/PythOracle.sol#L229

```solidity
function _recordPrice(uint256 oracleVersion, PythStructs.Price memory price) private {
    int256 expo6Decimal = 6 + price.expo;
    _prices[oracleVersion] = (expo6Decimal < 0) ?
        Fixed6.wrap(price.price).div(Fixed6Lib.from(UFixed6Lib.from(10 ** uint256(-expo6Decimal)))) :
        Fixed6.wrap(price.price).mul(Fixed6Lib.from(UFixed6Lib.from(10 ** uint256(expo6Decimal))));
    publishTimes[oracleVersion] = price.publishTime;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the potential integer overflow or underflow vulnerability in the `_recordPrice` function, follow these recommended steps:

1. Use SafeMath Library:
   Implement safe arithmetic operations by using a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath. SafeMath provides functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that prevent integer overflow or underflow.

   ```solidity
   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

   // Inside the contract
   using SafeMath for uint256;
   ```

2. Update Arithmetic Operations:
   Modify the `_recordPrice` function to use SafeMath for arithmetic operations. Ensure that the arithmetic operations are safe and do not result in integer overflow or underflow.

   ```solidity
   function _recordPrice(uint256 oracleVersion, PythStructs.Price memory price) private {
       int256 expo6Decimal = int256(6) + price.expo;
       uint256 exponent = uint256(-expo6Decimal);
       uint256 divisor = 10 ** exponent;

       if (expo6Decimal < 0) {
           _prices[oracleVersion] = Fixed6.wrap(price.price).div(Fixed6Lib.from(UFixed6Lib.from(divisor)));
       } else {
           _prices[oracleVersion] = Fixed6.wrap(price.price).mul(Fixed6Lib.from(UFixed6Lib.from(divisor)));
       }

       publishTimes[oracleVersion] = price.publishTime;
   }
   ```

By implementing these recommendations, you can ensure that the arithmetic operations in the `_recordPrice` function are safe and do not result in integer overflow or underflow, enhancing the security of the contract.
